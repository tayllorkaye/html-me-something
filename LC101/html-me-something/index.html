   <b> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans" target="_blank" NEW ORLEANS!> </b> </a>
This is my favorite city! New Orleans is one of the coolest places ive been in the states thus far!
The food, the culture, the people! I love the atmosphere all of it is something you have to expeirence.
My favorite part of the city though has to be the food. If you like seafood you have to try the seafood 
in NOLA. I havent had a bad meal in this city and im a pretty picky eater. So that says alot.

     <br> New York!! Wow! Forsure one of my favvorite cities. Just so we can get this out of the way
     the traffic here is terrible lol. The driving here also scares the daylight out of me. Yet this is still
     one of my favorite cities! The shopping here is amazing! My favorite part of the city is Manhattan.
     Time square is so insane. I went at 2 am on a Sunday and it was PACKED. All the shops stay open super
     late and as weird as it feels to be shopping at MAC at 1am its just as cool. There are 
     food places on every corner and i love how people kinda just mind their business here. Everyone looks
     super busy and unbothered! Definitley one of my favorites! If you havent gone you have to 
     do so soon!

   <h2 style="text-align:center;">Austin, TX</h2style="text-align:center;"></h2>

  <p> <b> <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin,_Texas" target="_blank" class= "center"> Austin, TX </b></a><br>
     
      <br> Who dosent love Texas?! Somtething about the weather in Austin really sets it off! <br>
          I Love warm weather with a hint of seasons and thats about what you get there! <br>
          Theres also a booming tech industry so there are plenty of jobs for anyone who is also
          in a career feild like tech. Compared to where i currently live.. Cold winters 	&gt; Warm winters.<br>

     


     <h2 style="text-align:center;">Los Angeles, CA</h2style="text-align:center;"></h2>
   <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/3orifeUzCMJ1Dho62Y/giphy.gif"  alt="Los Angeles" class="center">

   <p> <b> <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles" target="_blank"> LA!</b></a><br>
     <br> LA is such an expeirence! This is one of the busier cities ive experienced! The 
     traffic is really insane! Its true! It once took me 2.5 hours to go 14 miles and a 80 uber ride.
     Other than the fact that it takes entirely too long to get most places the city is really cool
     you could literally be pumping gas next to your celebrity crush and it not be a big deal. Lots
     of flashy cars and clothes, the term "Very Hollywood" definitley applies here. Theres tonsto do and 
     the weather is beautiful as well! I think my faveorite place to visit is Malibu. It has this 
     certain calm about it that makes you want to just stay forever! I think LA is definitley a 
     vibe. Depending on the type person you are you'll either hate it or love it.

     <h2 style="text-align:center;">Tampa, FL</h2style="text-align:center;"></h2>

   <p> <b> <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa,_Florida" target="_blank"> Tampa, FL + CLeawater Beach </b></a><br>
     <br> If you havent seen Cleawater Beach you should add it to your list of places to go ASAP!
     Its one of the nicest beaches that we have in the states! Also accompanied by tons 
     of cute little shops and yummy seafood resturants! Tampa in general is a beautiul place.
     From the excellent weather to the outdoor activities year round!
